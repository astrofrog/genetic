Getting started
===============

To understand how to run the genetic code, see the example in example1/.
The README gives instructions on running the example, while the
example1.py file contains a very detailed explanation of how the code
works. If you are really interested in the genetic algorithm itself, you
can view the code and comments in genetic/genetic.py
